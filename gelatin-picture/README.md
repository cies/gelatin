gelatin-picture
===============
An EDSL for describing two dimensional pictures.

Inspiration for the API comes from "A Language of Pictures", in "[Composing graphical user
interfaces in a purely functional language][1]" Copyright 1998 by Sigbj√∏rn Finne.

Implementation inspired by [Rasterific][2].

I also really like the idea of [nile][3], but that project seems to be dead :(
